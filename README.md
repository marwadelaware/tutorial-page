# tutorial-page
My project is called "Marwa's Tutorial Page," and it is a PINK tutorial page for rentry users to learn how to code things such as blinkies (rectangular gifs that can serve as buttons) and pixels (tiny gifs that resemble emojis) in HTML and CSS. I made this project because as a person who used Rentry to code my first website, it was pretty difficult finding the terms "blinkies" and "pixels" for HTML/CSS, so I had to do extensive research to find out how to properly implemenet them. I didn't want others to suffer the same way, so I decided to provide my knowledge to the world through this website. :p

I made this by using HTML and CSS, and I didn't follow many tutorials as my knowledge built up from Girls Who Code and my Personal Website, but I found out that you can make a slideshow without using Javascript, and instead using something called CSS scroll-snap. This was helpful to me as I didn't want to add many HTML files nor use Javascript (don't worry, I'll step out of my shell and try for my Project #3), and it also flowed quite smoothly. I thought that learning scroll-snap was going to be difficult, but it was pretty easy. 

The main thing I struggled with though? Procastination. Sometimes my brain perceives a task is arduous even though it really isn't, and what I've learned is to instead JUST DO IT!!!!!!! If I just write one line of code that barrier of procastionation, I feel that I'm already immersed, and that makes me finish coding earlier than I expect. I should carry this lesson all throughout my life and we should too lol.

ANYWAYYYYYY this is for Athena, a program ran by HackClub, encouraging female and non-binary coders to CODE!!!!! To go to a parathenon in nyc!! I can't wait!!! ^_^
